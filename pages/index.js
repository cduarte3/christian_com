        <h4><span class="tab"></span>Hello! My name is Christian Duarte, and if you are reading this, you are
          probably interested in who I am and what I have to offer as an aspiring software developer.
          <br/><br/>
          <span className="tab"></span>As you look further into this page, you will find out a little bit more about who I am, what my interests are, etc.
          <br/><br/>
          <span className="tab"></span>Along the top of the page, Ive included some tabs with things such as
          my resume, a list of currently finished and potential projects, and a feedback board for leaving
          me a message, review, or an idea of what to add to the site.

        <h4><span className="tab"></span>
          Currently I am 20 years old and am attending Seneca College at the Newnham Campus approaching
          my third year of studies.
          <br/><br/>
          <span className="tab"></span>
          The program I am enrolled in is the (BSD) Honours Bachelor of Technology - Software Development Program. A 4 year course, in which I intend to
          complete, and hopefully graduate with honours.

      <div className="interests">
        <h1>Interests</h1>
        <h4>
          As of late, my major interests have been any type of physical activities. These include going to the gym 4-5 times a week, and playing mens league soccer 1-2 times a week.
          <br/><br/>
          Aside from physical activities I enjoy watching movies and tv shows, playing video games, and hanging out with friends. Notably I enjoy horror, thriller, comedy, or superhero movies. I also
          collect comic books, mainly spier-man comics, as spider man is my favourite superhero, and I also enjoy anything to do with star wars.
          <br/><br/>
          I do enjoy programming, and working on frontend or backend of software, but I find it hard to do programming tasks on my own at home sometimes for personal tasks. I prefer more of a team environment
          and like working on larger scale projects with others.
